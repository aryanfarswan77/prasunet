# **Prasunet Internship Tasks**
Welcome to my internship tasks repository! This repo includes five machine learning and deep learning projects I worked on during my internship. 

## **Projects:**
1. Task 1:  K-means Clustering:
   - Description: Implement a K-Means Clustering model to group different customers based on their Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
   - Input:
     - Age of the Customers
     - Gender of the Customers
     - Annual Income of the Customers
     - Spending Score of the Customers
   - Output:
     - Divison of the Customers in different groups.

       
2. Task 2: Linear Regression:
   - Description Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
   - Inputs
     - Lot size of the house [in Square Feet].
     - Number of Bedrooms in the house.
     - Number of Bathrooms in the house.
   - Output-
     - Predicted Price of the house [in Dollars].


3. Task 3: SVM Classification
   - Description: Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
   - Input:
     - Images of Cats and Dogs
   - Output:
     - A classifer which labels images either into a Cat or Dog.   




4. Task 4:image_and_fooditems_recognisation using ml
   
   üîç Overview: In my final task, I developed a model to recognize various food items from images, utilizing deep learning techniques and computer vision. This project helped me explore image recognition pipelines, feature extraction, and neural networks, leading to accurate predictions and classifications.
