# **Prasunet Internship Tasks**
Welcome to my internship tasks repository! This repo includes five machine learning and deep learning projects I worked on during my internship. 

## **Projects:**
1. Task 1: Linear Regression:
   - Description Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
   - Inputs
     - Lot size of the house [in Square Feet].
     - Number of Bedrooms in the house.
     - Number of Bathrooms in the house.
   - Output-
     - Predicted Price of the house [in Dollars].


2. Task 2:  K-means Clustering:
   - Description: Implement a K-Means Clustering model to group different customers based on their Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
   - Input:
     - Age of the Customers
     - Gender of the Customers
     - Annual Income of the Customers
     - Spending Score of the Customers
   - Output:
     - Divison of the Customers in different groups.


3. Task 3: SVM Classification
   - Description: Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
   - Input:
     - Images of Cats and Dogs
   - Output:
     - A classifer which labels images either into a Cat or Dog.
